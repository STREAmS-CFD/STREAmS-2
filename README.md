Welcome to STREAmS-2 repository! 

STREAmS performs Direct Numerical Simulations of compressible turbulent flows in Cartesian geometry solving the unsteady, fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations for a perfect gas. Currently, three canonical wall-bounded flows can be simulated:

* compressible turbulent channel flow
* compressible zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer
* supersonic oblique shock-wave/turbulent boundary-layer interaction

STREAmS can be used on both local clusters and massively parallel HPC architectures, including those based on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs).

To start using it please go to the documentation page <https://STREAmS-CFD.github.io/STREAmS-2>.
